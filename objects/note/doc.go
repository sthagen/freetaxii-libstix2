Package note implements the STIX 2.1 Attack Pattern object.

The following information comes directly from the STIX 2.1 specification.

A Note is intended to convey informative text to provide further context and/or
to provide additional analysis not contained in the STIX Objects, Marking
Definition objects, or Language Content objects which the Note relates to. Notes
can be created by anyone (not just the original object creator).

For example, an analyst may add a Note to a Campaign object created by another
organization indicating that they've seen posts related to that Campaign on a
hacker forum.

Because Notes are typically (though not always) created by human analysts and
are comprised of human-oriented text, they contain an additional property to
capture the analyst(s) that created the Note. This is distinct from the
created_by_ref property, which is meant to capture the organization that created
the object.
