Package infrastructure implements the STIX 2.1 Infrastructure object.

The following information comes directly from the STIX 2.1 specification.

The Infrastructure SDO represents a type of TTP and describes any systems,
software services and any associated physical or virtual resources intended to
support some purpose (e.g., C2 servers used as part of an attack, device or
server that are part of defense, database servers targeted by an attack, etc.).
While elements of an attack can be represented by other SDOs or SCOs, the
Infrastructure SDO represents a named group of related data that constitutes the
infrastructure.
