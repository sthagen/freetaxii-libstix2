Package vulnerability implements the STIX 2.1 Vulnerability object.

The following information comes directly from the STIX 2.1 specification.

A Vulnerability is a weakness or defect in the requirements, designs, or
implementations of the computational logic (e.g., code) found in software and
some hardware components (e.g., firmware) that can be directly exploited to
negatively impact the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of that
system.

CVE is a list of information security vulnerabilities and exposures that
provides common names for publicly known problems [CVE]. For example, if a piece
of malware exploits CVE-2015-12345, a Malware object could be linked to a
Vulnerability object that references CVE-2015-12345.

The Vulnerability SDO is primarily used to link to external definitions of
vulnerabilities or to describe 0-day vulnerabilities that do not yet have an
external definition. Typically, other SDOs assert relationships to Vulnerability
objects when a specific vulnerability is targeted and exploited as part of
malicious cyber activity. As such, Vulnerability objects can be used as a
linkage to the asset management and compliance process.
