Package malware implements the STIX 2.1 Malware object.

The following information comes directly from the STIX 2.1 specification.

Malware is a type of TTP that represents malicious code. It generally refers to
a program that is inserted into a system, usually covertly. The intent is to
compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the victim's data,
applications, or operating system (OS) or otherwise annoy or disrupt the victim.

The Malware SDO characterizes, identifies, and categorizes malware instances and
families from data that may be derived from analysis. This SDO captures detailed
information about how the malware works and what it does. This SDO captures
contextual data relevant to sharing Malware data without requiring the full
analysis provided by the Malware Analysis SDO.

The Indicator SDO provides intelligence producers with the ability to define,
using the STIX Pattern Grammar in a standard way to identify and detect
behaviors associated with malicious activities. Although the Malware SDO
provides vital intelligence on a specific instance or malware family, it does
not provide a standard grammar that the Indicator SDO provides to identify those
properties in security detection systems designed to process the STIX Pattern
grammar. We strongly encourage the use of STIX Indicators for the detection of
actual malware, due to its use of the STIX Patterning language and the clear
semantics that it provides.

To minimize the risk of a consumer compromising their system in parsing malware
samples, producers SHOULD consider sharing defanged content (archive and
password-protected samples) instead of raw, base64-encoded malware samples.
